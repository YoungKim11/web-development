# My JavaScript learning journey

## The learning method
----
I'm using **The Odin Project** as a roadmap / learning structure on what to learn. Reading the coding docs as I go and afterwards using supplemental videos from **Udemy**, **freecodecamp** and other videos from different platforms. 

More to be added and updated as time goes on.
